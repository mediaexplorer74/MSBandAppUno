## Building the project
My fork of ["Band Center" solution](https://github.com/MicrosoftBandDev/companion-app) uses UNO "framework", 
which is still in the preview stages... 

Once you have the development environment set up, you're ready to clone the repo.
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/mediaexplorer74/MSBandCompanionApp
```

You need Visual Studio 2022 *Preview* to assemble (build) my solution.
