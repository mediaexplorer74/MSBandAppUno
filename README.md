Multi-platform Microsoft Band 2 (MSFTBandApp codename) companion app, superlite version without any great design. Draft/Proto.

Dev. engine: Xamarin Forms

## Status
- UWP / Android / iOS "platforms"
- Min. W10M os build descreased from 16299 to 15063 (hello, W10M)
- .net standard decreased from 2.0 to 1.4
- UWP platform: Bluetooth DI ready (proto)
- Android platform:  Bluetooth DI started to architect :)
- iOS platform:  Bluetooth DI is not ready at all 

## Problem
MS decided to "switch off" the MS Health "cloud" sync at Microsoft Band data. 
Date (year): 2020.

MS Band app for W10M planned to use One Drive to syncing "health" data via Microsoft Graph.

## Goal
Try to reilize/assemble the smalest (simplified) "remake" of Microsoft Band UWP app (W10M).
